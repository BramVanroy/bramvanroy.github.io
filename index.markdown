ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bram and I work on natural language processing and machine translation (evaluation) and I put a lot of emphasis on open science and open-source contribution.

ðŸ¤– I am a post-doctoral researcher in two academic institutions.  I work on machine translation evaluation at Ghent&nbsp;University thanks to a grant acquired from CLARIN.eu
for the [**MATEO**](https://lt3.ugent.be/mateo/) project (MAchine Translation Evaluation Online). I am also affiliated with KU&nbsp;Leuven where I work on the Horizon 
2020 project [**SignON**](https://signon-project.eu/), which aims to make strides in machine-translating to and from sign language. Within this European project,
I am focused on interlingual representations through meaning extraction and language modeling.

ðŸŒŒ In addition to my academic adventures, I also spend much of my time in the open-source universe. As a Hugging Face core contributor, I spent my time in the trails of repositories such as
[transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and [evaluate](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate), but I also frequent common NLP libraries such as 
[spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), [stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) and others. In the spirit of open scienec, I also publish my own code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/BramVanroy/), for instance [spacy-conll](https://github.com/BramVanroy/spacy_conll), an integration with spaCy to output CoNLL-U formats and
[astred](https://github.com/BramVanroy/astred), a research framework that calculates syntactic similarity between two sentences and includes word alignment functionality.

ðŸ”“ Some of the datasets, models, and demos that I have built are available on the [Hugging Face hub](https://huggingface.co/BramVanroy), including Dutch datasets
for building conversational models, models and a demo to extract meaning from multilingual texts, and models for sentiment analysis in Dutch.
